Gynaecological tests revealed PCOD, endometriosis, multiple cysts, and fibroids. I found myself in a cycle of visiting different doctors and hospitals, morning and evening managing my corporate job, but with no one able to identify the root cause. Each symptom was treated with multiple medications, but the underlying issue remained a mystery.<\/p><p>During peak of COVID, lumps appeared near my jawline, neck, and shoulder. A misdiagnosis led to a terrifying suspicion of cancer. I was told to wait 2 months to allow the lumps to grow for a conclusive diagnosis.

During my healing journey, I adopted a low-tox lifestyle, switching to low-tox products for everything from soap to food.

If more people adopt this lifestyle, it could create a demand for healthy products on a larger scale, encouraging significant changes in industry and government policies.<\/p><p>With this vision,
